<h1>The Story in the Book</h1>

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her
    desk, lying between the copies of <cite>Nature</cite>, <cite>New Scientist</cite>, and all the other
    scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of
    <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the
    longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an
    Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many
    considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,
    to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did </em>think she had something better to do.</p>

<h1>ОЧИ - АЦО ШОПОВ</h1>
<p>
    Три дена на раце те носевме збрана,
    со тага и болка на погледот срцен,
    и секоја капка на твојата рана
    ко крвава жар ни капеше в срце.
    Другарите беа и морни и гладни
    со згорени грла и свиени плеќи
    со тап бол се впија во очите ладни
    и жалеа оти не ќе пламнат веќе.
