<h2>position: static;</h2>
<p>An element with position: static; is not positioned in any special way; it is always positioned
    according to the normal flow of the page:</p>
<div class="static">
    This div element has position: static;
</div>

<h2>position: relative;</h2>
<p>An element with position: relative; is positioned relative to its normal position:</p>
<div class="relative">
    This div element has position: relative;
</div>

<h2>position: fixed;</h2>
<p>An element with position: fixed; is positioned relative to the viewport, which means it always stays in the same
    place even if the page is scrolled:</p>
<div class="fixed">
    This div element has position: fixed;
</div>

<h2>position: absolute;</h2>

<p>An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned
    relative to the viewport, like fixed).</p>
<div class="absolute">
    This div element has position: absolute;
</div>
<div class="relative">
    This div element has position: relative;
</div>
</body>
