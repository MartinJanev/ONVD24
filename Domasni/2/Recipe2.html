<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 ½ cups miniature marshmallows</li>
    <li>1 (7 ounce) bar milk chocolate candy</li>
    <li>½ cup milk</li>
    <li>2 cups heavy whipping cream</li>
    <li>1 (9 inch) pie shell, baked</li>
</ul>

<h2>Directions</h2>

<ol>
    <li>Heat marshmallows, chocolate candy, and milk in a saucepan over low heat until marshmallows and chocolate are
        melted, stirring constantly. Allow mixture to cool completely.
    </li>
    <li>Beat heavy cream in a large bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the
        whipped
        cream will form sharp peaks. Gently fold cooled chocolate mixture in whipped cream until well mixed; pour into
        baked pie shell. Refrigerate until set, about 3 hours.
    </li>
</ol>
