    <h2>Building Structure</h2>

    For the longest time the structure of a web page was built using divisions. The problem was that divisions provide
    no semantic value, and it was fairly difficult to determine the intention of these divisions. Fortunately HTML5
    introduced new <a href="https://dev.opera.com/articles/new-structural-elements-in-html5/">structurally based
    elements</a>, including the
    <!-- <header>,<nav>,<article>,<section>,<aside>,--> and <!-- <footer> --> elements.

    All of these new elements are intended to give meaning to the organization of our pages and
    improve our structural semantics. They are all block-level elements and do not have any
    implied position or style. Additionally, all of these elements may be used multiple times
    per page, so long as each use reflects the proper semantic meaning.

    Let’s roll up our sleeves and take a closer look.

    <h2>Header</h2>
    The<!-- <header> --> element, like it sounds, is used to identify the top of a page, article, section, or other
    segment of a page. In general, the <!-- <header> --> element may include a heading, introductory text, and even
    navigation.

<h2>Chapter 1</h2>

<p>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her
    desk, lying between the copies of <cite>Nature</cite>, <cite>New Scientist</cite>, and all the other
    scientific journals her work had appeared in, was a well thumbed copy of
    <cite>On The Road</cite>. It had been Molly's favorite book since college, and the
    longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she needed to be free.</p>

<p>She had spent the last ten years in this room, sitting under a poster with an
    Oscar Wilde quote proclaiming that <q>Work is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do</q>. Although many
    considered her pioneering work, unraveling the secrets of the llama <abbr title="Deoxyribonucleic acid">DNA</abbr>,
    to be an outstanding achievement, Molly <em>did </em>think she had something better to do.</p>
